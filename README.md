ashesi e-yearbook

the ashesi e-yearbook is a platform where students, faculty and staff of the Ashesi comminity can capture their memories without neccessarily needing a printed copy. the e-yearbook platform is solving the issue of the printed books being out of date in this technologically trending world. it also solves the issue of finding it difficult to distribute printed yearbooks amongst students and the fact that they are not interacting enough for those who have access to it. all yearbooks will be availble to everyone member of the community who is on the platform and there is no restrictions to the number of yearbooks that can be viewed. unlike the printed copies, you will have to get everyone of them from every year  before you can access them.
